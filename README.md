# Forest Fire Simulation

This project is a simple forest fire simulation built using Python and Pygame. The simulation visualizes how fire spreads through a grid representing a forest, where each cell can be grass, a tree, burning, or burnt. The user can interact with the simulation by planting trees, starting fires, and restoring burnt areas.

## Features

- Grid-based Simulation: A grid where each cell can represent grass, a tree, burning vegetation, or burnt land.
- Fire Spread: Trees are highly flammable, while grass has a lower chance of catching fire.
- User Interaction: 
  - Plant Trees: Left-click to plant trees on the grid.
  - Start Fires: Right-click to set a cell on fire.
  - Make It Rain: Use the "Make It Rain" button to turn all burnt cells back to grass.
  - Toggle UI: Press `H` to hide or show the UI elements like buttons.
  - Pause/Resume: Press `Space` to pause or resume the simulation.
  - Reset: Press `R` to reset the grid to its initial state.
  
## Installation

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python and Pygame installed on your system.

1. Python: Download and install the latest version of Python from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2. Pygame: Install Pygame using pip. Open a command prompt or terminal and run:
   ```bash
   pip install pygame
   ```

     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/SaiSrikarK03/forest-fire-simulation.git
     ```
   - Alternatively, you can download the project as a ZIP file from GitHub and extract it to your desired location.

### Running the Project

1. Navigate to the Project Directory:
   ```bash
   cd forest-fire-simulation
   ```
2. Run the Python File:
   - Execute the simulation by running the main Python script:
     ```bash
     python forest_fire_simulation.py
     ```

### Using the Simulation

- Plant Trees: Left-click on the grid to place trees.
- Start a Fire: Right-click on a cell to ignite a fire.
- Pause/Resume: Press the `Space` key to pause or resume the simulation.
- Reset Grid: Press the `R` key to reset the grid to its initial state.
- Toggle UI: Press the `H` key to hide or show the UI elements.
- Random Trees: Click the "Random Trees" button to randomly populate the grid with trees.
- Make It Rain: Click the "Make It Rain" button to turn all burnt cells into grass.
